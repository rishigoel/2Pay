# 2Pay

For this project, I've decided to walk you through my full design process.  

### Introduction 

Nowadays, people love using their mobile phones.  Some prefer using it over their PC.  In fact, there were 200 million more mobile users than desktop/laptop users last year.  Because of this trend, more and more systems are being integrated into mobile platforms, so that they do not reduce the overall UX.  Some have done this very well, while others have not.  When it comes to shopping on mobile platforms, conventional sites require the user to manually enter in their billing information and shipping address.  Manually typing in vast amounts of information on one's mobile phone leads to a poor user experience, as it can be confusing and time consuming.  

### Problem Statement

How can we simplify the mobile shopping process?

### Competitive Landscape

Others have tried to solve this problem.  On newer versions of iOS for example, the user can save their credit card information on their phone.  Sites light AO.com, Crate and Barrel, and Topshop have used design elements such as big buttons and progress bars to create a better experience.  AO.com also allows the user to type in their postal code, and the site determines their address for them.  Reiss uses a real-time address finder.  Finally, Card.Io, now a subsidiary of PayPal, created a library to gather the user's payment information by scanning their credit card.
